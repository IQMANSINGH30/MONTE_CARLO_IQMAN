//QUESTION STARTS
Deeksha is a dentist who schedules all her patients for 30 minute appointments. Some of the patients take more or less than 30 minutes depending on the type of dental work to be done. The following summary shows the various categories of work, their probabilities and the time actually needed to complete the work.

Simulate the dentist clinic for 4 hours and find out the average waiting time for patients as well as the idleness of the doctor. Assume that all the patients show-up at the clinic at exactly their schedule, arrival time starting at 8:00 a.m.



CATEGORY	 TIME REQUIRED	NO. OF PATIENTS	

FILLING	      45	               40	
CROWN	        60	               15	
CLEANING	    15	               15	
EXTRACTING	  45	               10	
CHECKUP	      15	               20	

Use the following random number for handling the above : 
40,82,11,34,25,66,17,79

//QUESTION ENDS

MS_PPT_1.py is a simulation model for one set of random variables which are generated by a python library that generates random variables
MS_PPT_2.py is simulation model like above but for 100 sets of random variables . we then take a mean of the 100 outcomes .
